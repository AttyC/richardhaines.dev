This is my personal portfolio website built with Gatsby. Its currently a work in progress.

Things im planning on adding:

- About
- 3 projects
- Tech stack 
- Contact 
- Blog
- CV/Resume

Im planning on building this out without the use of a CMS, all files will be local. I will use MDX for my blog, JSON Resume for my resume and JSON for my projects, Emotion for styling.
