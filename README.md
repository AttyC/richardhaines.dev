This is my personal portfolio website built with Gatsby, MDX and Theme-ui. Its currently a work in progress.

Things im planning on adding:

- About - Done
- 3 projects - Done
- Tech stack - Done
- Contact - Done
- Blog - Done
- CV/Resume

Im planning on building this out without the use of a CMS, all files will be stored in the filesystem and sourced via graphql queries. I will use MDX for my blog, JSON Resume for my resume and JSON for my projects, Theme-ui for styling.
