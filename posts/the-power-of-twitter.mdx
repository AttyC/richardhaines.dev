On friday i sent out a tweet. This tweet was a calling to all of the
twitterverse asking for support in spreading through their networks my wanting
of a new role. I sent this late in the night, just before i was going to bed
with the thinking that i would wake up and have a few likes and retweets.

How wrong I was! It absolutely exploded! This being of course relative to the
amount of traction my tweets normally get. I was so overwhelmed by the response!
So many times when we scroll through Twitter there is negativity, direct or
indirectly aimed at stacks, people, race, sex etc..

I love Twitter, I've only been using it for a short while, maybe a year or so
but I have found it a wonderful place to learn from and follow amazing people. I
guess it depends on the people you follow, but even then you get some negative
talk showing its ugly head via retweets or comments on tweets that people you
follow send.

But among the good and the bad sometimes comes wonderful things, I have received
two offers to chat about potential opportunities with really exciting companies!
Even if nothing comes of these opportunities in terms of work, i will have
learnt more by way of interviewing, gained confidence in my own ability to
attract work, and above all seen the power of Twitter as a tool when harnessed
in the right way.

I would also love to give a special shout out to all the corgis I hang with in
Chris Biscardi's [Party Corgi Discord](https://discord.gg/eRWFeSs) for their
love and support. ðŸ’–
