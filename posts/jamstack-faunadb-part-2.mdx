This is a two part series where we will create a JAMstack website powered by Gatsby, Netlify Functions, Apollo and FaunaDB. 

Our site will use the [Harry Potter API](https://www.potterapi.com/) for its data that will be stored in a [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) database. The data will be accessed using serverless functions and [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/). Finally we will display our data in a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site styled using [Theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/)

In this second part we will be creating our site, creating a database with FaunaDB and using serverless functions and Apollo to pull in our data and display it to the end user.

Now that we have a good overview of the stack we will be using lets get to the code!

### Installing dependencies and setting up the project

Navigate to your projects folder and create a new project folder and install the dependencies needed. We will add some more as we go but this will get us started.

```
mkdir harry-potter
cd harry-potter
yarn init- y
yarn add gatsby react react-dom theme-ui gatsby-plugin-theme-ui
```

Open up your code editor of choice (i highly recommend VScode because its amazing).

Create your folder structure:

```
mkdir -p src/pages/index.js
mkdir src/components
touch gatsby-config.js
touch gatsby-browser.js
touch gatsby-ssr.js
```

We'll also want to create some base components. We'll be using a gatsby layout plugin to make life easier for us. We'll also utilize some google fonts via a plugin. Stay with me...

```
mkdir -p src/layouts/index.js
cd src/components && touch header.js
cd src/components && touch main.js
cd src/components && touch footer.js
yarn add gatsby-plugin-layout
yarn add gatsby-plugin-google-fonts
```

Now we need to add the theme-ui, layout and google fonts plugins to our gatsby-config.js file:

```
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        {
            resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-google-fonts',
            options: {
              fonts: [
                'Muli',
                'Open Sans',
                'source sans pro\:300,400,400i,700' 
              ]
            }
        },
        {
            resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-layout',
            options: {
              component:             require.resolve('./src/layouts/index.js'),
            },
        },
          'gatsby-plugin-theme-ui'

    ]
}
```

Next lets create our layout. We'll keep it simple but this will be our first dive into theme-ui. This article wont cover the specifics of how to use theme-ui, for that i suggest going over another tutorial i have written which covers the hows and whys [how-to-make-a-gatsby-ecommerce-theme-part-1/](https://richardhaines.dev/how-to-make-a-gatsby-ecommerce-theme-part-1/)

```
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "theme-ui";
import React from "react";
import { Global, css } from "@emotion/core";

const PhoneTemplateAreas = `
  'nav      nav     nav     nav'
  'main     main    main    main'
  'footer   footer  footer  footer'
`;

const TabletTemplateAreas = `
  'nav      nav     nav     nav     nav     nav'
  'main     main    main    main    main    main'
  'footer   footer  footer  footer  footer  footer'
`;

const DesktopTemplateAreas = `
  '.    nav      nav     nav     nav     nav     nav    .'
  '.    main     main    main    main    main    main   .'
  '.    footer   footer  footer  footer  footer  footer .'
`;

const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <Global
        styles={css`
          * {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            box-sizing: border-box;
          }
          body {
            scroll-behavior: smooth;
            overflow-y: scroll;
            -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
            width: 100%;
            overflow-x: hidden;
          }
        `}
      />
      <div
        sx={{
          display: "grid",
          gridTemplateRows: "auto",
          gridTemplateColumns: [
            "repeat(4, 1fr)",
            "repeat(6, 1fr)",
            "repeat(8, 1fr)"
          ],
          gridTemplateAreas: [
            PhoneTemplateAreas,
            TabletTemplateAreas,
            DesktopTemplateAreas
          ],
          padding: "0 1em"
        }}
      >
        {children}
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default Layout;
```

With our grid area layouts looking like this:

```
const PhoneTemplateAreas = `
  'nav      nav     nav     nav'
  'main     main    main    main'
  'footer   footer  footer  footer'
`;

const TabletTemplateAreas = `
  'nav      nav     nav     nav     nav     nav'
  'main     main    main    main    main    main'
  'footer   footer  footer  footer  footer  footer'
`;

const DesktopTemplateAreas = `
  '.    nav      nav     nav     nav     nav     nav    .'
  '.    main     main    main    main    main    main   .'
  '.    footer   footer  footer  footer  footer  footer .'
`;
```

Now i want to stop i minute here and point out that this is the standard way i layout pages in my websites. That is, so long as the client or me (if its a site i have made alone) don't require any special or fancy layouts, this pattern will fix your basic site structure 99% of the time. Its a simple, responsive and will cover most use cases.

If you checked out the linked article above you will notice that we are covering the same ground here. Lets create our header, main and footer components: 

#### Header

```
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "theme-ui";

const Header = props => (
  <header
    sx={{
      gridArea: "nav",
      padding: "1em",
      backgroundColor: "background",
      color: "text",
      height: "100%",
      padding: [null, "2em", "2em"],
      paddingTop: ["2em", null, null]
    }}
  >
    {props.children}
  </header>
);

export default Header;
```

#### Main

```
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "theme-ui";

const Main = props => (
  <main
    sx={{
      gridArea: "main",
      backgroundColor: "background",
      minHeight: "calc(100vh - 60px)",
      paddingTop: ["2em", "60px", "60px"]
    }}
  >
    {props.children}
  </main>
);

export default Main;
```

#### Footer

```
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "theme-ui";

const Footer = () => (
  <footer
    sx={{
      gridArea: "footer",
      display: "flex",
      flexDirection: "column",
      alignItems: "center",
      justifyContent: "center",
      backgroundColor: "background",
      color: "text"
    }}
  >
    <p
      sx={{
        color: "text",
        fontFamily: "body",
        fontSize: ["0.7em", "0.8em", "1em"],
        letterSpacing: "text",
        fontWeight: 400,
        margin: "1em auto"
      }}
    >
      This is my footer!
    </p>
  </footer>
);

export default Footer;
```

To provide an easy way to style our whole site through changing just a few variables we can utilize the gatsby-plugin-theme-ui. 

```
cd src && mkdir -p gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js
```

In this file we will create our sites styles which we will be able to access via the [theme-ui sx prop](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop/).

```
export default {
  fonts: {
    body: "Open Sans",
    heading: "Muli"
  },
  fontWeights: {
    body: 300,
    heading: 400,
    bold: 700
  },
  lineHeights: {
    body: "110%",
    heading: 1.125,
    tagline: "100px"
  },
  letterSpacing: {
    body: "2px",
    text: "5px"
  },
  colors: {
    text: "#FFFfff",
    background: "#121212",
    primary: "#000010",
    secondary: "#E7E7E9",
    secondaryDarker: "#545455",
    accent: "#DE3C4B"
  },
  breakpoints: ['40em', '56em', '64em']
};
```

Much of this is self explanatory, the breakpoints array is used to allow us to add responsive definitions to our inline styles via the sx prop. For example:

```
    <p
      sx={{
        fontSize: ["0.7em", "0.8em", "1em"],
      }}
    >
      Some text here...
    </p>
```

The font size array indexes corresponded to our breakpoints array set in our theme-ui index file.

Now that we have our base site structure setup we can leave the frontend and begin the exciting process of writing our serverless functions!

### Serverless functions setup

We'll need to create a functions folder at our projects root which will be where we will store our serverless functions, database schema, resolvers and fauna client creation. This is where

```
mkdir functions/graphql
cd functions/graphql && touch db.js graphql.js resolvers.js schema.js
```

Lets begin by setting up our fauna client. First we will need to grab our API key from our fauna dashboard. Create a new account at [fauna.com](https://fauna.com/) and then create a new database, call it Potter or whatever you like. Now we want to create a collection, which is a document that is made up of fields and their values, like a JSON object. Their docs have a deep explanation about what and how this all [works](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/fql/documents).

Name our first collection Characters. This will hold al of the characters from the potterverse. Next up we will create our first index. An index in fauna is a way of retrieving documents by attributes. See their [documentation ](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/fql/indexes)for more information. 

Name our new index as allCharacters, leave all the default settings as they are, with serialized selected. While we are at it we can create two more collections and indexes. 

- One for House, with a corresponding allHouse index 
- One for Spells with a corresponding allSpells index

We will be creating some more indexes for fetching our characters, houses or spells by their id or name later on.
